      <p>Dear Agent Pepper,</p>
      <p>
        We have an emergency. The secret formula for our Mega Marshmallow has been
        compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most
        delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We suspect that Professor <span class="blurred">Puff</span> is behind this. He has
        taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab
        and secure the formula before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information
        could jeopardize the entire operation.
      </p>
      <p>For more details, please contact us. <span class="blurred">Important</span></p>
      <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
      <p>Best regards, <span class="blurred">The Team</span></p>
